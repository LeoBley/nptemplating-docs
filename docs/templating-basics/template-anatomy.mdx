# Template Anatomy
`np.Templating` templates use a format called [Frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/), that is commonly found in blogging platforms which utilizes templates to render dynamic content, and is a great fit for the way NotePlan integrates normal note taking features, but infuses a robust calendaring system.

## Template Configuration
There are two parts to a NotePlan template. Depending on the type of template you are creating, there will be at least two attributes, and template body.

The template must start with three dashes `---` followed by template attributes, then three more dashes `---` and then the template body, which will be the content that will be rendered when invoking any of the `np.Templating` commands.

All templates must be placed in the "Templates" folder, which can be found in NotePlan Sidebar, located in the "Smart Folders" section.

## Template Sections
There are two sections in a NotePlan template, template `attributes` and template `body`.

### Template attributes

`attributes` - The attribute section is between opening `---` and closing `---` tags, and contains all configuration key/value pairs, separated by colon `:` character.

:::warning REQUIRED ATTRIBUTES
All templates must have at least two required attributes `title` and `type`.
:::

| Attribute | Description
| --- | :---
| title | The title attribute is the name of template, and will appear in the Templates folder
| type | The type attribute determine the type of template, and will control where it is accessible from.

The following are the the list of possible `type` values:

| Type | Description
| --- | :---
| empty-note | is a generic note and can be used for anything that will be processed by the various `np.Templating` commands such as `np:new`, `np:insert`, `np:append`, `np:invoke`
| meeting-note | templates will be available when selecting any of the locations associated with meetings (those displayed in NotePlan calendar)
| quick-note | templates are accessible when invoking the `np.Templating` quick note command `np:qtn`
| template | Used with the `<%- include(/** **/) %>` tag, used when creating including templates within other templates

:::info IDENTIFY TEMPLATE FRONTMATTER
NotePlan will display the frontmatter attributes in an alternate tint color

### Template body

`body` - The remainder of template, placed after the second delimiter line`---` is the template content and will be use when template is rendered.

**Example**

```markdown
---
title: Template title
type: empty-note
---
Everything below the second `---` will be template content

--
created: <%- date.now('dddd MMMM Do, YYYY HH:mm A') %>
--

< -- [[<%- date.yesterday('YYYY-MM-DD') %>]] | [[<%- date.tomorrow('YYYY-MM-DD') %>]] -- >

And the remainder of the template will be display here ...
```

## Template Attribute Processing
When a template is processed, the first portion will be template attributes, where you can use static text, or other `np.Templating` commands to provide the setup, before moving onto rendering the template body.

:::info REENTRANCE SUPPORT
When `np.Templating` is rendering a template, it processes in a top-down fashion and uses a process know as "reentrance", which provides the ability to reference any previous attribute values as the basis for the current attribute.
:::

## Template Body Processing
After the attributes have been processed, the next pass will process the template body.  You can use any of the supported `np.Templating` [modules](/docs/templating-modules/overview), or reference any `attribute` from the processed template attributes.

**Example**

The following example will perform the following

- `startDate` will be supplied based on prompt for user to enter start date value

- `endDate` will use the `startDate` value from previous attribute, and subtract 7 days, using `add` method in [Date Module](/docs/templating-modules/date-module)

- `formattedDate` demonstrates how to create custom formatting, using `startDate` and `endDate` attributes

- In the template body, you will see how we can use any of these attributes to produce further formatting, etc.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="template" label="Template" default>

```markdown
---
startDate: <%- prompt('startDate','Enter Date') %>
endDate: <%- date.add(startDate, 7) %>
formattedDate: <%- startDate %> to <%- endDate %>
type: empty-note

**Frontmatter Processing**
x
In this example, the following occurs
- The  `startDate` attribute is supplied from user input (prompt)
- The `endDate` attribute is derived by the *DateModule* `add` method, adding 7 days to whatever the user entered
- And finally, the full date is displayed below

#### Date Range
**Start Date:** `<%- startDate %>` *value entered from prompt*
**End Date:** `<%- endDate %>` *calculated adding 7 days to `startDate`*
**Formatted Date:** `<%- formattedDate %>` *calculated	 from `startDate` and `endDate`*

## Template Body Processing
In this example, the following occurs
- Create reminder value using `startDate` and `subtract` method

**Reminder:** `<%- date.subtract(startDate, 7) %>`
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="output" label="Output">

**Frontmatter Processing**

In this example, the following occurs
- The  `startDate` attribute is supplied from user input (prompt)
- The `endDate` attribute is derived by the *DateModule* `add` method, adding 7 days to whatever the user entered
- And finally, the full date is displayed below

#### Date Range
**Start Date:** `2022-05-21` *value entered from prompt*

**End Date:** `2022-05-28` *calculated adding 7 days to `startDate`*

**Formatted Date:** `2022-05-21  to 2022-05-28` *calculated from `startDate` and `endDate`*

Template Body Processing
In this example, the following occurs
- Create reminder value using `startDate` and `subtract` method

**Reminder:** `2022-05-14`
