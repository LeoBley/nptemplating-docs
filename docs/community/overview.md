# Overview
This section will contain content driven by NotePlan community requests, recommendations etc and in some cases, be created entirely by a community member.

### Support Requests
We receive requests in a variety of formats, whether it be from a Discord request, GitHub issues, Twitter, or via direct messages (Discord, Twitter, Email, etc.)

We have reproduced the requests (permission requested where applicable and noted in attribution) here so that the NotePlan Community can see the first hand the power of `np.Templating`, and be used as inspiration for workflow tips you may choose to incorporate to your personal workflows.

### Submitting Content
If you have a specific templating workflow that you feel would be beneficial to others, please feel free to reach out to us using the [Contact Us](/docs/contact-us) page.
