# Quick Notes
Sometimes, you have templates that you apply often, and you would like to specify in advance, for example, the folder you want a new note to be placed in, the title of the note, and the template to use for the content.`np.Templating` **Quick Notes** are more specific templates for creating new notes.

## Quick Notes Templates
By default, Quick Notes templates are located in "ðŸ—’ Quick Notes" however you can place them where you wish within the "@Templates" folder.

:::caution
Due to utilization of advanced templating features, Quick Note templates must be frontmatter style, legacy templates are **not** supported.

### Using Quick Notes
When you create a Quick Note template, it becomes available via the `np:qtn` command. When invoking the `np:qtn`, you will see the **Quick Note Template Picker**, where you can select the desired Quick Note template for which you want to create a new note.

![Template Chooser](/img/quicknotes-chooser.png)

**Step 1:** Invoke NotePlan Command Bar (`Command-J`)

**Step 2:** Type `np:qtn` (or any of the `qtn` [aliases](/docs/templating-commands/overview/#npqtn))

**Step 3:** Select desired template

After selecting the desired Quick Note, a new note will be created in the defined folder location as defined in the Quick Note template header.

:::note
If you only have a single Quick Note in the "ðŸ—’ Quick Notes" folder, it will be selected automatically and the Template Chooser dialog will not be displayed.
:::

### Quick Note Template Required Attributes
Each Quick Note must contain each of the following items:

- `title` - contains the template title (this is what will appear in `np:qtn` template chooser)
- `type` - specifies that this is a Quick Note template (should include `quick-note` in this CSV list)
- `newNoteTitle` - will be name of new note. You can use any `np.Templating` module method, such as `<%- date.now() %>`, or a prompt command such as `<%- prompt('meetingSummary','What would you like to discuss') %>`
- `folder` - path to folder where new note will be created

:::danger ATTRIBUTE NAMING REQUIREMENTS
All template attributes values must start with an alpha character (a..z, A..Z) and may not include illegal characters such as `#` otherwise must be surrounded with double quotes. To be safe with any frontmatter attribute, it is always a good idea to wrap in quotes as to not lead to issues down the road.
:::

**Bad:**

The following attribute value will cause any FrontMatter module method to return an empty attribute block
```
title: - invalid character #includingHasTag
```

**Good:**

The following attribute value be properly parsed as it is surrounded in quotes

```
title: "- invalid character #includingHasTag"
```

:::

**Example:**

The following example outlines the 4 mandatory field in a Quick Note template

```markdown
---
title:  Codedungeon Call
type: quick-note
newNoteTitle: <%- prompt('meetingSummary','What would you like to discuss') %> <%- date.now() %>
folder:  "Projects/Sample/FooProject"
