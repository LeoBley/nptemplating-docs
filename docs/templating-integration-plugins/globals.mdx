# Globals
`np.Templating` has implemented global methods which were created using `addTag` method in `nmn.Templates/src/templateController.js` method to aid in migrating legacy templates to `np.Templating`

The following methods are available for backwards compatibility with legacy templating, you should use the alternate method where defined.

| legacy method | new method where applicable
|-------------- | ----------
| affirmation | `<%- web.affirmation() %>`
| advice | `<%- web.advice() %>`
| quote | `<%- web.quote() %>`
| progressUpdate | _currently no replacement_
| weather | `<%- web.weather() %>`
| data8601 | `<%- date8601() %>`
| currentDate | `<%- date.now() %>`
| pickDate | _currently no replacement_
| pickDateInterval | _currently no replacement_
| events | _currently no replacement_
| listTodaysEvents | _currently no replacement_
| matchingEvents | _currently no replacement_

## Using Custom Methods in Templates
If you are creating a new NotePlan plugin which needs access to custom methods, you should use the approach described in [Example 3 - Custom Methods](/docs/templating-integration-plugins/example-3)
