# Introduction

`np.Templating` is a template language plugin for NotePlan that lets you insert variables and method results into your notes. It will also let you execute custom JavaScript constructed in the templates providing a rich note taking system.

## Why Use Templates

Templates enables you to create structured and consistent notes for repetitive tasks. When invoked by one of the many `np.Templating` commands (e.g. `np:new`, `np:append`) the templating plugin replaces placeholders in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into a NotePlan note. This approach makes it easier to create notes in your day-to-day work.

- Encourages consistent notes (data generation is separate from presentation code).
- Output generation is more expressive (template syntax doesn't require a sea of string concatenation)
- Better productivity (common problems such as output encoding, iterating, conditionals, etc. have been handled).

### Example
For example, one of the unique features of NotePlan is the ability to combine normal note taking features (the _Note_) with an integrated calendar environment (the _Plan_) which provides a terrific place to manage a big part of your day-to-day work.

When viewing the meeting in the NotePlan Calendar View, you may wish to link the event to a NotePlan Meeting note

![NotePlan Event](/img/noteplan-event.png)

Clicking on the "Link Note" button at the top of the event

![NotePlan Event](/img/noteplan-link-note.png)

You may select from one of the `meeting-note` templates in the "Templates" folder

Any template which contains a type of `meeting-note` will be available in the NotePlan Meeting Note template chooser

When you select the desired template and click "Create Meeting Note", NotePlan will generate a new note, replacing template placeholders with information from the selected event, using a template such as the following

![NotePlan Event](/img/noteplan-meeting-note-template.png)

The end result will be a new note, which has a consistent format, making it easy to identify the important parts when you review notes in the future. Each of the placeholders (e.g. `<%= calendarItemLink %>` or `<%- eventNotes %>`) will be replaced with event attributes where applicable

## Configuration

`np.Templating` has a number of [settings](/docs/settings) which you can use to control how data is supplied and formatted when rendering templates.

### Advanced: Integrating into your plugins (for developers)

You can also use the np.Templating functions from within a custom plugin you are developing. For example:

```javascript
import NPTemplating from "NPTemplating";

export async function templatingHelloWorld(): Promise<void> {
  try {
    const result = await NPTemplating.renderTemplate(
      "Template - Hello World",
      {}
    );

    Editor.insertTextAtCursor(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("templatingHelloWorld", error);
  }
}
```
