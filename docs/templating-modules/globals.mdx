<!-- My changes mean that I'm not sure this page should still be called 'Globals' ... but not quite sure what to call it. 'Globals' seems to be about the solution, not the problem it solves, so may not be as useful to non-pro-devs. -->

# Module Methods
The following original methods have replacements in np.Templating:

| original method | replacement `np.Templating` method
|-------------- | ----------
| advice | `<%- web.advice() %>`
| affirmation | `<%- web.affirmation() %>`
| currentDate | `<%- date.now() %>`
| date8601 | `<%- date8601() %>`
| quote | `<%- web.quote() %>`
| weather | `<%- web.weather() %>`

Each is now part of a module, rather than being ...

# Global Module Methods
`np.Templating` has implemented globally-namespaced methods which were created using `addTag` method in `nmn.Templates/src/templateController.js` method to aid in migrating legacy templates to `np.Templating`. Those methods, provided by other plugins, are therefore still available for use in templates, through being compiled into np.Templating:

| original method | provided by plugin
|-------------- | ----------
| events() | Event Helpers
| matchingEvents() | Event Helpers
| progressUpdate() | Summaries
| sweepTasks | Task Sweeper
| weekDates | Date Automations

_I'm not sure how to characterise these:_

| original method | provided by
|-------------- | ----------
| formattedDateTime | ??? <!-- I'm not sure which one this comes from -->
| pickDate | <!-- from helers; should this be removed entirely as it is similar to prompt() ? -->
| pickDateInterval |  <!-- ditto -->

## Using Custom Methods in Templates
If you have created your own NotePlan plugin and wish to use it's methods in a template, follow this example.

We have a method `sayHello` which would be referenced in a template as `<%- sayHello('Mike') %>`

```javascript
import NPTemplating from 'NPTemplating'

export async function templatingHelloWorld(): Promise<void> {
  try {
    const templateData = {
      methods: {
        sayHello: (name: string = '') => {
          return `Hello ${name}`
        }
      }
    }
    const result = await NPTemplating.renderTemplate('Template (Say Hello)', templateData)

    Editor.insertTextAtCursor(result)
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('templatingHelloWorld', error)
  }
}
```

:::tip
When using `np.Templating` in NotePlan Plugins, you should use the approach described in [Example 3 - Custom Methods](/docs/templating-integration-plugins/example-3)
